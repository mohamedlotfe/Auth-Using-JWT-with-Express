## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

To install this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using your preferred method (HTTPS or SSH):

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/mohamedlotfe/Auth-Using-JWT-with-Express.git
   # OR
   git clone git@github.com:mohamedlotfe/Auth-Using-JWT-with-Express.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root and set your environment variables. You should define values for `JWT_SECRET` and other necessary configurations.

   Example `.env` file:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   JWT_SECRET=yourSecretKey
   ```

5. Start the application:

   ```shell
   npm start
   ```

The application should now be running locally on the specified port (default is 3000).

## Usage

To use this project as a basis for your own authentication and authorization system, follow these steps:

1. Create your own models for user data and adapt the database schema according to your requirements.

2. Update the authentication and authorization middleware to suit your application's needs. You can modify the `auth.js` file and the `routes/index.js` route.

3. Customize the error handling and responses in the `user.js` file.

4. Secure your routes by using the functions in your route definitions.

5. Implement additional features and functionalities as needed for your project.

## Features

- User registration with hashed passwords
- User login with JWT generation
- Authentication middleware to protect routes
- Authorization middleware to control user access to specific resources
- Example protected route for demonstration
- Error handling and response customization
